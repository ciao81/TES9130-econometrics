## Private R code for the TES9130- econometrics course

The aim of this repository is to provide R code translated from the course's STATA code for training and reproducibility purposes. I extend certain functions when I see it fit, mainly for visualization and explanatory reasons.  
I cannot accept any guarantee of completeness, correctness or accuracy. 

Participation is encouraged!!!  
-   [This blog post](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html) from Karl Broman provides a nice short introduction how to contribute to a repository
-   Please try to follow some coding style conventions. The [Google Styleguide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml) provides some best practice examples



The R files are organized according do the do.files (every R file represents a do.file). Eventually missing packages have to be installed by yourself with: 

    install.packages("your package goes here")

package "checkpoint" and package "ProjectTemplage" are optional and have to be only set up once. Don't forget to change the working directory according to your system: 

    setwd("your system path here")

Comments style in the R files is: 

   * #: Main comment above some function or file header
   * ##: Note/ explanation comment - either at the right side of a function or below a function
   * ### Question/ To do: improve the function or find a solution for a given problem - either at the right side of a function or below a function
