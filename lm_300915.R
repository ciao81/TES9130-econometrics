### Run IV regression where experience and schooling are instrumented with age and mother and father education
# Generate age762 square
age762<- Schooling$age76^2
summary(age762)               ### Output ok!


### Run IV regression where experience and schooling are instrumented with age and mother and father education


### Generate table to compare OLS and IV
